# Discord Wider User Area

This is a [BetterDiscord](https://betterdiscord.app/) plugin that makes the user area at the bottom left of the screen expand left into the server list.

## Compatibility

I really tried my best to make this work with as many other themes and plugins as possible. Specifically, I guarantee that this works with [BetterAnimations](https://betterdiscord.app/plugin/BetterAnimations) and [Midnight](https://betterdiscord.app/theme/midnight) since I use them myself. If you find any incompatibilities, please let me know by opening an issue.
